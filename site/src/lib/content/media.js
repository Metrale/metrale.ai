// =============================================================================
// The media manifest. Every video and poster the marketing pages reference is
// declared here, so media.test.js can prove each file exists and the
// scripts/media pipeline knows what to render.
//
// Files live under static/media, three per clip: <name>.mp4, <name>.webm and
// the poster <name>.webp. Where a clip comes from is in its name:
//
//   console-<scene>  a screen recording of the Metrale Console product mockup
//                    running a scripted scene on demo data. The mockup is a
//                    private project and is NOT in this repository; only its
//                    recordings are. media-brief/README.md says where it lives
//                    and how to re-record.
//   broll-<scene>    a procedural loop drawn from the brand palette by
//                    src/lib/broll/scenes.js and recorded from /broll.
//
// A slot can be replaced by dropping new files of the same name, which is how
// a generated clip from the prompt pack in media-brief/ gets onto the site
// once it is approved: scripts/media/install.mjs does the encode.
