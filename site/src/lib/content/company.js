// The name, as the founders explained it on 2026-09-21: the word for measure,

// and the American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots (the root me-,
// to measure, which also gives moon and month); Protagoras is quoted in
// Plato's Theaetetus 152a; the national accounts and the warning are from

    'The name Metrale is built on metron, the Greek word for measure. It is the root of meter, metric, geometry and symmetry, and further back, of moon and month, the first measures of time. Protagoras used it when he called man the measure of all things. It is the oldest word for knowing how much.',
    'Economies were run on instinct until they were measured. In 1934 Simon Kuznets gave the United States Congress its first national income accounts, and within a decade those accounts were how nations were compared and managed. Today the number is called GDP. Kuznets warned in the same report that the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from its income. The number was a beginning, not a verdict.',
    'Inference is where economies were then. Fleets report tokens per second the way a mill once reported spindle speed, and few can say what a GPU hour produced, what a workload cost, or when the fleet paid for itself. Metrale keeps those accounts: the gross product of inference, by model, cluster and business unit, against the baseline you ran before. Measure first, then manage.'
