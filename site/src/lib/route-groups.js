// The site is three documents that share a header, not one.
//
// The marketing pages load avarok.css. The developer pages (/engine, /control,
// /diligence) load app.css and its companions, a different design system whose
// rules are written against bare elements: `nav`, `header`, `section`. Each
// group's layout imports only its own stylesheets, and on a full page load that
// keeps them apart.
//
// The client router does not. It never removes a stylesheet, so moving from one
// group to the other by a client side navigation leaves both systems in the
// page. Worse, the router PRELOADS a link's code and styles when the pointer
// rests on it, so merely passing over "Developers" on the way to "Company"
// injected app.css into a marketing page and collapsed its header. Nothing had
// been clicked. A refresh cured it, which is what made it look random.
//
// So a link that crosses groups is always a full page load, and is never
// preloaded. The root layout marks such links `data-sveltekit-reload` the moment
// the pointer, the focus or a finger reaches them, which is before the router
// looks, and refuses any navigation that still crosses (a `goto`, the back
// button). This file is the rule. src/routes/+layout.svelte applies it.
