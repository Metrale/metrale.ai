# Cloudflare Pages hosting

atlascybernetics.ai and blog.atlascybernetics.ai are served by Cloudflare Pages.
There is no origin server in the request path, which is the point: the previous
host went down and took both properties with it.

## Projects

| Project | Serves | pages.dev |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `avarok-site` | `atlascybernetics.ai` | `avarok-site-80h.pages.dev` |
| `atlas-blog` | `blog.atlascybernetics.ai` | `atlas-blog-3ja.pages.dev` |

Both are **Direct Upload** projects, not Pages' git integration. The build in
`.github/workflows/site.yml` needs an `atlas-recipes` checkout and a GitHub
token, and it carries four gates a Pages-native build would bypass — the
flagship-recipe check, the per-route `<title>` checks on both properties, and
the blog/site cross-link check. CI builds, CI uploads the gated output.

`--branch=main` on the upload is load-bearing: a deployment on any other branch
gets a preview URL and does not move the custom domain. That fails as "the
deploy went green and the site is stale".

## The forms

The site's three forms post to a small Worker, `avarok-forms`, kept in
[`forms-worker/`](forms-worker/README.md). It is deployed by hand with `wrangler deploy`,
apart from the site, so nothing about it can take a page down. Until it is deployed and
its address is set as `formEndpoint` in `src/lib/content/brand.js`, each form drafts an
email in the visitor's own mail app instead.

## Metrale Prime, the guide

The chatbot on every page talks to a second Worker, `metrale-prime`, kept in
[`prime-worker/`](prime-worker/README.md): the model key, the knowledge base cut
from the built pages, a daily budget and rate limits live there, and the page
holds nothing but the Worker's address (`primeEndpoint` in
`src/lib/content/brand.js`; empty means no guide on the site). It deploys from
`.github/workflows/prime-worker.yml` on a push that touches it, or by hand from
that directory; the README says which secrets it needs and how they were
handled while it was built.

## What replaced the nginx config

`../nginx/atlascybernetics.ai.conf` is kept because the origin is still mirrored
to as a warm standby. On Pages the same behaviour comes from:

- **`static/_headers`** — the security headers and the cache policy. Read the
  note at the top of that file before editing it; Pages concatenates a
  re-declared header rather than replacing it, which silently cost the hashed
  assets their year-long cache once already.
- **`src/routes/404/+page.svelte`** — prerenders to `build/404.html`. Pages has
  no `try_files ... =404`; with no such file it answers every unmatched path
  with index.html and a **200**, so broken links return the front page and
  crawlers index unbounded soft-404s.

## www -> apex, and why `www` is deliberately NOT a custom domain

The nginx `if ($host = www...)` block has no in-repo Pages equivalent.
`_redirects` path rules work (verified: a path-only rule redirects correctly)
but the documented absolute-URL form does **not** match on these projects
(verified: `https://www.atlascybernetics.ai/* ...` never fired). A path rule is
useless here anyway, since it would bounce the apex too.

So it is a zone-level Redirect Rule on `atlascybernetics.ai`:

    expression: (http.host eq "www.atlascybernetics.ai")
    action:     redirect, 301
    target:     concat("https://atlascybernetics.ai", http.request.uri.path)
    preserve query string: yes

**`www.atlascybernetics.ai` must stay OFF the Pages project for that rule to
run.** It was attached at first, and the rule — stored, enabled, correct
expression — did nothing: every request still returned 200 with the site.
A Pages custom domain is served by the Pages edge and never reaches the zone's
ruleset engine. The tell is in the response headers: the apex returns
`cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC` and `www` returned no `cf-cache-status` at all.
Detaching it made the redirect fire on the first request afterwards.

The `www` DNS record stays a proxied CNAME to the apex. It needs no origin and
no Pages binding, because a redirect rule is evaluated before Cloudflare
resolves one — the request never looks for something to serve.

Creating or editing the rule over the API needs a token with **Zone -> Dynamic
Redirect -> Edit**, on top of the Pages, DNS and Cache Purge permissions the
rest of this setup uses. A token holding only some of those fails with
`request is not authorized` on the ruleset write while still listing rulesets
happily, which reads like a bug and is not one.

## atlasinference.io -> atlascybernetics.ai

`atlasinference.io` is a legacy hostname on the same `avarok-site` Pages
project. It still answers 200 with the marketing site, including
`/engine`. The public developer URL is `https://atlascybernetics.ai/engine`.

`_redirects` host rules do not fire here (same measurement as `www`). Do
this in the **atlasinference.io zone**, not in the Pages project:

    expression: (http.host eq "atlasinference.io") or (http.host eq "www.atlasinference.io")
    action:     redirect, 301
    target:     concat("https://atlascybernetics.ai", http.request.uri.path)
    preserve query string: yes

**`atlasinference.io` and `www.atlasinference.io` must be detached from
the Pages project** or the rule never runs — every request keeps returning
200 with the site. After detaching, keep the DNS records as proxied CNAMEs
onto `atlascybernetics.ai` (or the Pages `pages.dev`) so the rule sees the
request.

The origin standby vhost is `../nginx/atlasinference.io.conf`.
